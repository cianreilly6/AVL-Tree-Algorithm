# AVL-Tree-Algorithm
The program reads a CSV file containing English-Spanish word pairs, inserts them into an AVL tree, computes the height of the tree, and translates a given English sentence into Spanish using the AVL tree for word lookups. The AVL tree ensures efficient insertion and search operations, maintaining balance for optimal performance.
